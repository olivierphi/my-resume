# Dunsap.com - online resume

What could be more pleasant than totally over-engineering your online resume when you're a Web Developer in 2024? ðŸ˜„

## History of the various versions

Here is the history of this traditionally over-engineered CV project:
 - [The very first version](https://github.com/olivierphi/my-resume/tree/v1) was using Node.js, CoffeeScript, Vagrant and gulp (2013! âŒ›).
 - The second version, in 2016, was written in [goold ol' PHP](https://github.com/olivierphi/my-resume/tree/php-version).
 - The third one, in 2017, was built [with isomorphic React](https://github.com/olivierphi/my-resume/tree/react-version) as I was in the process of getting up to speed with React.
 - After that I wanted to give Vue.js a shot, so in 2018 I wrote [an isomorphic Vue.js version](https://github.com/olivierphi/my-resume/tree/vue-version). I wasn't a huge fan of Vue.js in the end, but I still kept that version running for a few years.

Well, for this 5th flavour I opted for... a [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/)-based setup!

So, in order to generate only 2 HTML pages and 2 PDF files, I had the pleasure to use all these wonderful technologies: âœ¨

- A Django project that parses my resume data (stored in [TOML](https://github.com/toml-lang/toml) format, now readable by Python's own standard library ðŸ’š) and inject it into HTML templates.
- Live generation of the CSS file, powered by [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) - without any dependency on Node.js, thanks to [django-tailwind-cli](https://github.com/oliverandrich/django-tailwind-cli).
- Live reloading in the browser, powered by [django-browser-reload](https://github.com/adamchainz/django-browser-reload).
- Automatic local copy of Google Fonts, thanks to [django-google-fonts](https://github.com/andymckay/django-google-fonts).
   _(see [Public CDNs Are Useless and Dangerous](https://httptoolkit.com/blog/public-cdn-risks/) or  [The Court Says, Donâ€™t Use Google Fonts](https://insights.project-a.com/the-court-says-dont-use-google-fonts/) for the rationale behind it)_
- PDF files are generated from the static Web assets, via [Playwright](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright-python).
- All these static files are deployed to GitHub Pages by [ghp-import](https://github.com/c-w/ghp-import).
- [A GitHub Action](.github/workflows/deploy.yml) builds and deploys the static assets automatically on every push to the branch.

On top of that I've also used some classic Python and Django packages, such as:
 - [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/)
 - [MyPy](https://www.mypy-lang.org/)
 - [Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
 - [Ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/) _(still using Black for formatting at the moment, though)_
 - [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/)
 - [djLint](https://www.djlint.com/)
 - [django-fastdev](https://github.com/boxed/django-fastdev)

## Is it really over-engineered?

```bash
$ ls -l .venv/lib/python3.12/site-packages/*/METADATA | wc -l
64
```

Yes it is! âœŒ ðŸ˜…

#### N.B. Only 5 direct dependencies are needed to build and deploy the project

To be fair, there are 8 direct "dev dependencies" to manage things such as live reloading or code quality,
but only 5 direct packages are actually needed to build and deploy the project from scratch in the GitHub Actions pipeline.
So I imagine that the amount of third-party code installed there should be more reasonable...

Alright, let's check that locally:
```bash
$ python -m venv .venv-ci --prompt .venv-ci
$ source .venv-ci/bin/activate
(.venv-ci) $ pipx run poetry==1.7.1 install --no-root --only=main,deployment
(.venv-ci) $ ls -l .venv-ci/lib/python3.12/site-packages/*/METADATA | wc -l
20 # better! ðŸ˜Œ
```


## Usage

All is needed is the venerable-and-ubiquitous [Make](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_(software)) and Python 3.12 (via [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv-installer#readme) for instance).

```bash
$ pyenv use 3.12
$ make install # will create a virtual env in ".venv/"
$ make dev # starts the Django server on port 8000, with live reloading
```

To build the static assets (HTML, CSS, images, PDF versions...)
```bash
$ make build-and-create-pdfs
```

In the CI pipeline powered by GitHub Actions, the whole process
(installing the dependencies, building the static Web assets, generating the PDF files, and pushing all these static files to the `gh-pages` branch)
takes about 40 seconds which is not too bad. ðŸ™‚
